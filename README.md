# ETL-IM

#### Introduction
>The purpose of the ETL-IM is to get specific data from `bigquery-public-data:noaa_gsodÂ´ BigQuery dataset.
>The data that we need is the minimum and maximum daily temperatures in degrees Celsius by state between the years 1990 and 2000.
>Whe we get all of it, we load to our MySQL database.
>The last thing to do is to check that we have correctly injected our data, to ensure
>that we have created an script which when you pass an state you get an histogram
>for all the minimum an maximum celsius temperatures between the years 1990-2000
